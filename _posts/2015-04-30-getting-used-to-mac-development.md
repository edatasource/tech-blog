Before starting at EDS, we were all Windows folks.  We're all pretty sold on OSX now, but there is an adjustment period where you have to figure out what incantations it takes to get the useful things that you're used to from Windows.

Here are some useful tidbits we had to figure out to adjust to Mac-land:

**You can delete characters by hitting `Fn + Backspace`!**

## Development tools

### Git tools

- [GitX](http://gitx.frim.nl/) - for creating new commits and looking over the diff
- [Beyond Compare](http://www.scootersoftware.com/download.php) - a good diff/merge tool.  Not quite as quick or intuitive as TortoiseDiff/WinDiff, but way better than the other alternatives I tried.
- [Trailer](https://github.com/ptsochantaris/trailer) - notifications for new pull requests, and a handy list of all currently open pull requests in your system bar

### MySQL GUI clients

Our team is actually pretty divided on which MySQL client they use.  None of them are anywhere as good as SQLYog, but the ones who couldn't stand MySQL Workbench any more get by with these:

- [SequelPro](http://www.sequelpro.com/)
- [0xDBE](https://www.jetbrains.com/dbe/), or IntelliJ's built-in SQL client

## OS tools

- [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) - similar to AutoHotKey, lets you set up keyboard shortcuts and macros
- [SizeUp](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/) - snaps windows to sides of the screen like Windows+Left/Windows+Right, and also gives shortcuts for full-screening and sending windows to different monitors
- [GrandPerspective](http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/) - like WinDirStat, gives a visual overview of hard drive usage
